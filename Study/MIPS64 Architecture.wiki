2.1 MIPS Instruction Set Overview
2.1.1 Historical Perspective								perspective:透视，看法
============================
	The MIPS IV_tm and MIPS V_tm levels of the ISA added improved floationg
	point operations,as well as a set of instructions intended to improve t-
	he efficiency of generated code and of data movement.
CPU Registers(64):
	r0 - r31: 63 --- 0 32个通用寄存器64位长度。
	HI : 63 --- 0 
	LO : 63 --- 0 
	PC : 63 --- 0 Special Purpose Registers
FPU Registers:
	1. 32 floating point registers(FPRs).These registers are 32 bits wide i-
	   n a 32-bit FPU and 64 bits wide on a 64-bit FPU.
