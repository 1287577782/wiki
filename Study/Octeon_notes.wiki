1.If 1:1 mapping is not used,memory is not mapped into the user segment.Instead 
it is accessed either via xkphys(for 64-bit applications),or via inline assembly
code.Virtual address "0"(the first 1 MByte)is usually unmapped.
If virtual address "0" is unmapped, a NULL pointer access will cause the core to
crash because there is no TLB exception handler.
