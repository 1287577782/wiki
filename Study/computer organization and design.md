## Introduction
Computer technology has made incredible progress in the past half century.In 1945,there were no stored-program computers.

Today,a few thousand dollars will purchase a personal computer that has more performance,more main memory,and more disk  storage than a computer bought in 1965 for $1 million.This rapid rate of improvement has come both from advances in the technology used to build computers and from innovation in computer design.

While technological improvements have been fairly steady,progress arising from better computer architectures has been much less consistent.

> consistent:someone who is `consistent ` always behaves in the same way,has the same attitudes towards people or things,or achieves the same level of success in something.

During th first 25 year of electronic computers,both forces made a major contribution;but beginning in about 1970,computer designers became largely dependent upon intergrated circuit technology.
