## Introduction
Computer technology has made incredible progress in the past half century.In 1945,there were no stored-program computers.

Today,a few thousand dollars will purchase a personal computer that has more performance,more main memory,and more disk  storage than a computer bought in 1965 for $1 million.This rapid rate of improvement has come both from advances in the technology used to build computers and from innovation in computer design.

While technological improvements have been fairly steady,progress arising from better computer architectures has been much less consistent.

> consistent:someone who is `consistent ` always behaves in the same way,has the same attitudes towards people or things,or achieves the same level of success in something.

During the first 25 year of electronic computers,both forces made a major contribution;but beginning in about 1970,computer designers became largely dependent upon intergrated circuit technology.During the 1970s,performance continued to improve at about 25% to 30% per year for the mainframes and minicomputers that dominated the industy.

> mainframe:A `mainframe` or `mainframe computer` is a large powerful computer which can be used by many people at the same time and which can do very large or complicated tasks.

The late 1970s saw the emergence of the microprocessor.The ablility of microprocessor to ride the improvements in integrated circuit technology more closely than the less integrated mainframes and minicomputers led to a higher rate of improvement---roughly 35% growth per year in performance.

This growth rate,combined with the cost advantages of a mass-produced microprocessor,let to an increasing fraction of the computer business being based on microprocessors.In addition,two significant changes in the computer marketplace made it easier than ever before to be commercially successful with a new architecture.First,the virtual elimination of assembly language programming reduced the need for object-code compatibility.Second,the creation of standardized,vendor-independent operating systems,such as UNIX,lowered the cost and risk of bringing out a new architecture.These changes made it possible to successively develop a new set of architectures,called RISC architectures,in the early 1980s.Since the RISC-based microprocessors reached the market in the mid 1980s,these machines have grown in performance at an annual rate of over 50%.

Prior to the mid 1980s,microprocessor performance grouth was largely technology driven and averaged about 35% per year.The increase in growth **since then** is attributable to more advanced architectural ideas.
