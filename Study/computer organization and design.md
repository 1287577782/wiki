## Introduction
Computer technology has made incredible progress in the past half century.In 1945,there were no stored-program computers.Today,a few thousand dollars will purchase a personal computer that has more performance,more main memory,and more disk
storage than a computer bougt in 1965 for $1 million.This rapid rate of improvement has come both from advances in the
technology used to build computers and from innovation in computer design.
