	L2TP支持包括IP、ATM、帧中继、X.25 在内的多种网络。在IP网络中，L2TP协议
	使用注册端口 UDP 1701。[1]因此，在某种意义上，尽管L2TP协议的确是一个数
	据链路层协议，但在IP网络中，它又的确是一个会话层协议。
rfc3931:
	l2tp:layer two tunneling protocol.

	L2TP Control Connection Endpoint(LCCE)
	An L2TP node that exists at either end of an L2TP control connection.
	May also be referred to as an LAC or LNS,depending on whether tunnele-
	d frames are processed at the data link(LAC) or network layer(LNS).

	Data messages are used to encapsulate the L2 traffic being carried ov-
	er the L2TP session.Unlike control messages,data messages are not ret-
	ransmitted when packet loss occurs.

	L2TP Data Header	L2TP Control Header
	L2TP Data Channel	L2TP Control Channel
	   (unreliable)			(reliable)
	Packet-Switch Network(IP,FR,MPLS,etc.)

	Data memssages are passed over an unreliable data channel,encapsulated
	by an L2TP header,and sent over a Packet-Switched Network(PSN 分组交换
	网络)such as IP,UDP,Frame Relay,ATM,MPLS,etc.Control messages are sent
	over a reliable L2TP control channel,which operates over the same PSN.

	The necessary setup for tunneling a session with L2TP consists of  two
	steps:(1) Establishing the control connection,and (2)establishing a s-
	ession as triggered by an incoming call or outgoing call.An L2TP sess-	trigger:触发器
	ion MUST be established before L2TP can begin to forward session fram-
	es.Multiple sessions may be bound to a single control connection , and
	multiple control connections may exist between the same two LCCEs.

L2TP Control Message Header
	The T bit MUST be set to 1, indicating that this is a control message.	T位必须置1，表示是一个控制消息。

	The L and S bits MUST be set to 1,indicating that the Length field and
	sequence numbers are present.

	The x bits are reserved for future extensions.All reserved bits MUST 
	be set to 0 on outgoing messages and ignored on incoming messages.

	The Ver field indicates the version of the L2TP control message header
	described in this document.On sending, this field MUST be set to 3 for
	all messages(unless operating in an environment that includes L2TPv2[R
	FC2661] and/or L2F[RFC2341] as well,see Section 4.1 for details).

	The length field indicates the total length of the message in  octets,
	always calculated from the start of the control message header  itself
	(beginning with the T bit).

	Non-zero Control Connection IDs are selected and exchanged as Assigned
	Control Connection ID AVPs durin the creation of a control connection.

	The Session Header MUST provide a method of distinguishing traffic am-
	ong multiple L2TP data sessions and a method of distinguishing data m-
	essages from control messages.
	会话头必须提供一个能从多个L2TP数据会话中区分通信的方法，和一个区分是数
	据消息还是控制消息的方法。
	Each type of encapsulating PSN MUST define its own session header cle-
	arly identifying the format of the header and parameters necessary  to
	setup the session.Section 4.1 defines two session headers,one for tra-
	nsport over UDP and one for transport over IP.

	The L2-Specific Sublayer is an intermediary layer between the L2TP se-	intermediary:adj.中间人的,调解的.n:中间人
	ssion header and the start of the tunneled frame.It  contains  control
	fields that are used to facilitate the tunneling of each frame.The de-	facilitate:vt.促进，帮助
	fault L2-Specific Sublayer for L2TPv3 is defined in Section 4.6.

Control Conection Teardown:
	Control connection teardown may be initiated by either LCCE and is ac-
	complished by sending a single StopCCN control message.As part of  the
	reliable control message delivery mechanism,the recipient of a StopCCN	mechanism:n.机械，机构，结构，机理，技巧
	MUST send an ACK message to acknowledge recepit of the message and ma-
	intain enough control connection state to properly accept StopCCN ret-	properly:ad.适当地
	ransmissions over at least a full retransmission cycle(in case the ACK	retransmission:重发，重传，转发
	message is lost).The recommended time for a full retransmission  cycle
	is at least 31 seconds

	通过StopCCN 可以关闭控制连接，和所有与控制连接有关的会话。所以没有必要
	在关闭控制连接的时候，独立地关闭每个会话。				detect:vt.发觉，察觉，探测

Session Teardown:
	Session teardown may be initiated by either the LAC or LNS and is acc-
	omplished by sending a CDN control message.After the last  session  is 
	cleared,the control connection MAY be torn down as well (and typically
	is).
